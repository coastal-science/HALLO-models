# HALLO-models

Welcome to the public model repository of the The HALLO 
(Humans and ALgorithms Listening for Orcas) project!


## Description

Here, you will find the instructions, scripts and configuration files 
required to train deep learning models at detecting and classifying 
vocalisations made by killer whales.

Of course, instructions and configuration files alone won't do. You will 
also need access to large bodies of annotated underwater sound recordings. 
Unfortunately, these recordings are not yet publicly available, although we 
are working feverishly to change this! Please check in here again 
soon for instructions on how to access the data. 


## Models

Currently, the only available model is a binary classifier for detecting 
killer whale vocalisations (pulsed calls, mainly). To find out more about 
this model, click the link below.

More models, including models capable of classifiying vocalisations at finer 
levels of resolution, e.g., according to ecotype or even pod, will be released 
in coming years.
